DualGrid Demo use 2 x CLASS TGrid(), based on Listview (SysListView32)
Like Windows Explorer you can switch View Style and use SHFileOperation() to copy,move, rename or delete File(s)

DualGrid Demo have different Style e.g. use Checkbox (Device iPhone) or use “virtual” Grid (More Property)
which can handle Array Data “on-fly” up to 100.000.000 Elements

You can add new TAB ( TFolder ) on each TGrid() using n-Dim Array with #xtranslate
Between both TGrid is a SPLITTER
Right-click on TGrid() will open Popup Menu
You can use Darkmode (see Color Menu)
Can attach Device which have no Drive Letter like iPhone to Download Photo
will detect add/remove USB Device
“safe” Eject USB Device
CONFIG.INI (save only 1st TAB of each TGrid() )
